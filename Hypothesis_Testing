One sample t test
Steps we need to take while carrying out a hypothesis test.

Step 1: State the hypothesis
        Null hypothesis: U = 50
        Alternative hypothesis: U != 50 (two tailed test)
                                U < 50 (one tailed test)
                                U > 50 (one tailed test)
                                
Step 2: Calculate the t-statistic (t-calc)
sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample size(n),and
hypothesised mean(U)
tstatistic = (sample mean - hypothesised mean(U))/
              (standard deviation/sqrt(sample size(n)))
              
Step 3: Determine the degrees of freedom (read about this)
df: sample size(n) - 1

Step 4: Determine the confidence level (alpha = 100% - conf level)
95% (5% = 0.05) , 99%(1% = 0.01), 90%(10% = 0.1)

Step 5: Determine the t-tabulated (t-tab)
two tailed test: t(alpha/2, df)
                 e.g t(0.025, 19)
In R, the code would be 
qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)
                 qt(1-(alpha/2), df) e.g
                 qt(1-(0.05/2), 19) = 2.093024
                 
one tailed test: t(0.05, 19)
qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)
                 qt(1-(alpha), df) e.g
                 qt(1-(0.05), 19) 
                 
                 
##Example 1
H0:U=50, H1: U < 50, n = 20.
alpha = 0.05, df = 19 

from the tables: (-1.729)
from R: qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)
qt(0.05,19) = -1.729133

##Example 1
H0:U=70, H1: U > 50, n = 25.
alpha = 0.05, df = 24 

from the tables: (1.711)
from R: qt(area to the left of the critical value, df)
qt((1-0.05),19)

Step 6: Making conclusion
